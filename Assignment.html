    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>👤 About the Author
<br>
<br>
        My name is Urijah Belle, and I’m an aspiring author from Barbados. I haven’t published any books yet, but I enjoy writing because it helps me express myself and see the world differently. Outside of writing, I’m really into football — it keeps me focused and motivated. I’m also working toward becoming an economist one day, which is a big goal of mine. Writing gives me a creative outlet and helps me think deeper about life and people. This portfolio is a reflection of who I am right now and the kind of stories I want to tell.</p>

    <h2>Selected Works & Prefaces</h2>
    <h3>📰 News Article – “Common Cold Eradicated”</h3>
    <p>I chose this article because it shows how I can write in a professional tone and use real-world topics to grab attention. I liked how I used quotes from different people to build both excitement and concern, just like real journalism. One thing I’d improve is the length — I think I could’ve added more detail to give the article more depth and structure.</p>
    <h3>📑 Information Paragraph – “The Dangers of Boxing”</h3>
    <p>I’m proud of this piece because it taught me how to use research and facts to build a strong argument. I think the structure is solid, and I made a clear point about how dangerous boxing can be. I’d improve the grammar and clean up some of the transitions to make it flow better.</p>
    <h3>📸 Photo Essay – “Urban Art”</h3>
    <p>This was one of the most creative assignments I worked on. I liked how I could tell a story using photos instead of just words. It helped me think about angles, framing, and how visuals affect storytelling. If I did it again, I’d try to take clearer, more dynamic pictures to better support my theme.</p>

    <h2>Plot Graph of "The Sniper"</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exposition:</strong> <span class="quote">“Dublin lay enveloped in darkness but for the dim light of the moon...”</span> — Sets the time, place, and mood of the story during the Irish Civil War.</li>
      <li><strong>Rising Action:</strong> <span class="quote">“Almost immediately, a bullet flattened itself against the parapet.”</span> — Danger increases as he risks a smoke and nearly gets shot.</li>
      <li><strong>Climax:</strong> <span class="quote">“His enemy had been hit.”</span> — The sniper outsmarts his enemy and wins the rooftop battle.</li>
      <li><strong>Falling Action:</strong> <span class="quote">“The sniper looked at his enemy falling and he shuddered.”</span> — The adrenaline fades, and guilt sets in.</li>
      <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> <span class="quote">“Then the sniper turned over the dead body and looked into his brother’s face.”</span> — The tragic twist is revealed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Theme Statement</h2>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> War destroys more than lives — it destroys families, humanity, and the self.</p>
    <p><span class="quote">“Then the sniper turned over the dead body and looked into his brother’s face.”</span></p>
    <p>This moment reveals the true cost of civil war — not just death, but emotional destruction. War turns loved ones into enemies and leaves survivors with guilt that can never be undone.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conflict Paragraph</h2>
    <p>The main conflict in <em>The Sniper</em> is <strong>man vs. man</strong>, and it has the biggest impact on the climax.</p>
    <p><span class="quote">“His enemy had been hit. He was reeling over the parapet in his death agony.”</span></p>
    <p>The sniper’s fight against his enemy drives the entire story. It’s a physical and mental battle, and when the enemy is killed, it leads directly to the final twist, showing how personal and painful war can be.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>TPPE Paragraph</h2>
    <p>The sniper would likely make a different choice if he knew the true consequences of his actions. At the end of the story, he discovers he killed his own brother: <span class="quote">“Then the sniper turned over the dead body and looked into his brother’s face.”</span> Earlier, he was focused only on survival: <span class="quote">“He must kill that enemy and he could not use his rifle.”</span> But knowing the truth, he would probably hesitate or try to avoid the fight. This shows how war blinds people to reality — the cost is only clear when it’s too late.</p>

    <h3><strong>Headline:</strong> Tragedy on the Rooftops: Civil War Turns Brother Against Brother</h3>
    <p><strong>Byline:</strong> Urijah Belle | April 10, 2025 | Dublin, Ireland</p>
    <p>A dramatic and tragic firefight took place last night in the heart of Dublin, where a Republican sniper unknowingly gunned down his own brother. The incident occurred during ongoing clashes between Republican and Free State forces.</p>
    <p>One eyewitness, a soldier stationed nearby, stated, “It was intense — gunfire back and forth. You could tell the sniper was fighting for his life.”</p>
    <p>The sniper, hiding near O’Connell Bridge, used a clever decoy trick to eliminate his opponent. After the battle, he crossed the road to identify the body and was horrified to discover it was his brother.</p>
    <p>“This war is tearing families apart,” another witness commented.</p>
    <p>The emotional cost of civil war continues to rise in Dublin. As tensions grow, this heartbreaking story serves as a reminder of what war truly destroys.</p>
